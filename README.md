# pokemoon
Some idiot tries to decompile Pokemon Moon. Most likely will never be finished.

I am not trying to perfectly decompile Pokemon Moon, but rather to decompile a MINIMAL VERSION. That said, I have no idea what I'm doing. So, yeah.

# Building
There's nothing here yet. Good luck trying to build an empty repository lol.
In all seriousness I'm at school rn so I can't really do anything except plan out my approach. Will update probably sometime around the weekend?

# Contributing
Would appreciate contributions. I am using Ghidra with the Ghidra CTR Loader by Martmists-GH. I am definately doing something wrong, as this is my first decomp project. Any PRs that help the decomp will be accepted. Thanks!
